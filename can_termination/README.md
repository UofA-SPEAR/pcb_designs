# CAN Termination Board #

This is just a small board, designed to go on every electrical 'box' that has some options for CAN passthrough and termination to allow for a more "plug-and-play" approach to CAN bus.

It simply has two pass-through connections (so you can keep internal wiring consistent) and two termination connections (so you can hook boxes up in isolation without really worrying about which boards have termination resistors.
