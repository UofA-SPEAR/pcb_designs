# SPEAR PCB Designs #

Central repository to hold PCB designs for SPEAR.

## Arm-Controller ##

Baseboard for using several of Adafruit's stepper motor driver boards, as well as some servo headers using a PCA9685.

## Motor-PTCs ##

Small board to add PTCs (resettable fuses) to the output of our motor drivers.

## Power-Distrib-Example ##

Power distribution board for the drive and computer systems. Includes a 5V regulator for arduino and raspberry pi power suplies as well as a fuse for the TX2

## SPEAR-arm-position ##

A small board with a potentiometre to read positional data for the arm. Uses standard AMPMODU MTE connectors. Designed by Jarrett Yu and tweaked for dimensional correctness by David Lenfesty.
